/**
 * Given a String passed as parameter, can you write a method to calculate input word anagrams?
 *
 * An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to
 * produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example Torchwood
 * can be rearranged into Doctor Who. The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the
 * anagram. Anagrams are often used as a form of mnemonic device as well.
